I used to use Doodle all the time for finding days that worked best for groups of people to meet. At some point in the last few months, Doodle released a bunch of updates and the SUPER basic functionality that I had used for years suddenly didn't work the way it used to.

So I'm making an app to fix it. This app has the very basic Doodle functionality of being able to pick a bunch of dates and people can select Yes, No, or If Needed on each of the dates. THATS ALL IT DOES.
